# Learning how to learn

Focused and Diffused thinking

1. Focused mode helps for intense studying, but diffuse mode helps to come up with novice ideas. Diffuse mode kicks in when you change activity (like going for a walk).
2. Working memory - has 4 slots, is not good enough for complex things. Storage memory - saves data in compact mode, good enough to store things for long time, but requires time and repetition to form required neural patterns.
3. Spatial repetition - neural networks are better formed when repeated not every day, but within few days periods (1-2)
    1. Sleep (8h) is required to wash out toxins from daily brain activity. Otherwise it doesn’t work.
4. Physical exercise is important to form new neurons in some parts of the brain - leads to better memory and ability to learn.

Chunking

1. Chunk is a network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions.They are single easy-to-access items of storage memory, that easily fit to one of the 4 slots of working memory.
2. Chunks are build with Focused Attention, Understanding and Practice.
3. Simple Recall without looking into material is the best way to form chunks. Trying to recall in the different place form where you’ve actually learned the material helps in forming chunks.
4. Transfer - the same chunk may be used in different areas.
5. Interleaving - trying to apply different learning techniques all in one session - leads to more flexible chunks.
6. Illusions of competence:
    - Test yourself (Recall)
    - Minimize highlighting - it gives false illusion that material goes to your brain (better do notes in your own words)
    - Mistakes are good
    - Use deliberate practice (more complex tasks)
7. Einstellung - initial idea or strong neural pattern that keeps you from finding better solution (being flexible)
8. Law of Serendipity - start by doing small things, and the rest will come.

Procrastination

1. Procrastination tackling - pomodoro actually works (5 min treatment is sufficient for brain)
2. Keep a planner journal (checklist)
3. Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day
4. Write down tasks for the next day in the evening before
5. Do rewards, but delay them until you finish the task
6. Watch for procrastination cues (notifications, messages, etc.). Try to put yourself in new environment with less disturbing factors.
7. When it is time to relax - relax without guilt or worry - gain trust in your new system.
8. Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate (like watch TedX instead of surfing sport sites)
9. Eat frogs first - start with tasks you don’t like.

Memory

1. Working memory - 4 slots only, serves as a bad blackboard.
2. Long-term memory - chunks, take time to form them
3. Human brain has outstanding visual and spatial memory systems (try to involve more senses in remembering - imagination, smells, etc., “Memory palace”)

Unlocking your potential

1. Metaphors and analogy work for every type of knowledge (not only art)
2. You can change your life by changing your thoughts (making new neuron patterns) - needs practice
3. Step back when the work is done, take a break, and revisit what you’ve done with bigger picture in mind
4. Do check lists before complex activities (like pilots)
5. "Hard start, jump to easy” technique - start from harder problem, then allow diffuse mode to kick in while you are doing easy tasks, and go back to hard one after that
6. Cortisol - body's reaction to stress and nervousness. Change your thinking from “I’m getting nervous” to “I’m getting excited”. Deep breathing with the stomach helps to reduce cortisol level.
