# Escaping the build trap

## Part 1. The build trap

Is when company focuses on the number of features delivered, not their value. 

Product management practices can solve this.

Value exchange system: Business provides the service, that solves Customer's problem, in exchange for money. 

Simply increasing the output may not increase the profit.

Project-based development cycle - deadlines, milestones, when the project is over, the team moves to the next one. Inspired by PRINCE2, PMBOK.

Products are vehicles of value, they deliver value repeatedly without requiring to build something new.

Product needs to be nurtured to maturity by iterating multiple projects.

Product-led orgs vs Sales-led vs Visionary-led vs Technology-led.

Part 2: The role of Product Manager

Product manager - understands business and customer.

Bad product manager archetypes:

- mini CEO
- the waiter
- former project manager

Great product manager:

- not just product owner in Scrum
- tactical work is achieved with projects
- strategic work is about position the product within company or the company itself in the market
- operational is about tying strategy to tactical work

The more Senior PM is - more strategic work is done.

Part 3. Strategy

Good strategy isn't a plan, it is a framework.

Knowledge gapÂ  - alignment gap - effects gap.

User stories start from Agile teams and must go all the way up the management chain. Timescale will increase.

**Strategy deployment** (OKR, Hoshin Kanri) allows teams to make decisions on a daily basis without paralysis. Levels of strategy deployment:

- vision (CEO)
- strategic intent - what business challenges on the way to our vision (senior leaders)
- product initiative - what problems should we solve to address challenges (product leaders)
- options - what are the ways to solve those problems (product dev team)

**Strategy creation**.

PDCA (Plan Do Check Act) - on each level, iteratively.

Part 4: Process

Product Kata.

- understand direction
    - set success metrics
- explore problem
    - talk to customers!
- explore solution
    - experiment, Lean
- optimize solution
    - evolve vision if needed

1. what is the goal?
2. where we are now in the relation to that goal?
3. what is the biggest problem or obstacle standing in the way of reaching this goal?
4. how do I try to solve this problem?
5. what do I expect to happen?
6. what actually happened, and what did we learn?

Remember, it is not customer job to solve their problems. It is your job to ask the right questions.

We are building to learn, not to earn.
