**The non-straightforward path**

- In every culture, religious or not, the question of how to live is central.
- Numerous religions and philosophies were devised, ranging from mystical to hyper-rational.
- Stoic philosophy stands somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. S. is about practicing virtues and navigating the world to the best of our abilities. It involves reflecting on theoretical precepts, reading inspirational texts, engaging in meditations and other mindfulness techniques.
- Why S. (M.P.):
    - Buddhism is too mystical, its texts are hard to interpret. Secular humanism is too rational, relies too much on science, hard to explain to others.
    - S. is rational, science-friendly, includes metaphysics, spiritual dimension
    - S. is open to revision
    - S. is eminently practical.
    - Most directly addresses the question of inevitability of death.
    - Psychological theories (like V. Frankl’s logo therapy) are rooted in stoic approach.

**A road map for the journey**

The theoretical foundation of S. is the idea that in order to live a good (eudemonic) life, one has to understand two things: the nature of the world (and by extension one’s place in it) and the nature of human reasoning (including when it fails, which it does very often).
