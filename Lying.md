- In committing to being honest to everyone, we commit to avoiding a wide range of long-term problems, but at the cost of short-term discomfort.
- In many circumstances in life false encouragement can be very costly for another person.
- Honesty demands that we communicate any uncertainty about the relevance of our opinions (but tell them anyway).
- Lying closes the door to acts of honest communication that might be more effective or produce moral breakthrough.
- A willingness to be honest - especially about the things one might be expected to conceal - often leads with much more gratifying experience with other human beings.
- Vulnerability comes in pretending to be someone you are not.
- Golden Rule: are you concealing a secret that you would want to know about if you were the other person?
